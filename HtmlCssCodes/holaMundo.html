      <h2>A Story of a fallen hero</h2>
      <div class="container2">
      <p> Once two friends were walking through the forest. A forest full of ideas and dreams of a project. They knew that anything dangerous can happen to them at any time in the project. So they promised each other that they would remain united in the forest of ideas any case of danger.

Suddenly, they saw a large bear approaching them. One of the friends at once left him to die in the forest of dreams. But the other one was finding him. So being led by his common sense, he stopped searching and started walking towards the bear.
The bear came near the 2nd friend . It smelt in his ears and realized he has been betrayed and left him along to grief. Now the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground,
“Friend, what did the bear tell you into your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a false friend and added khankirpola tor mare sudi” and they happily lived after in peace.</p>
